## UX

### Developer's goal
- Learn to build a chat web application using React in the front end and Firebase serving the backend
- Gain practical knowledge in the best practices of using React to build reusable components
    + Objectives to be met includes:
        * Understanding of React Routing and React Context hooks
        * Firebase integration as database and for social authentication
        * Integration of Chat Engine REST API
        * Making REST API calls in react using Axios module
        * Using environment variables to hide sensitive data

### User Stories
- As a first time visitor, I want to receive notification confirming it is me siging up via the social authentication
- As regular user, I should be able to join a chat room, so that I can engaged with other users
- As the creator of a chat-room, I have the ability to add new users to the chat room, so they can participate in the activities
- All users should be able to view current status members in the current chat room joined

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Social Authentication buttons - allows the users to login or sign-up via their google or facebook credentials
- Sound notifications - allows users, engaged in chats, to be alerted if activities are taking place in a chat room
- User Status - allows for users to view current status of participants in a chat room
- Avatar images - allows for users to view an image representation of chart participants
- My Chats Add Button - allows for the creation of chat rooms
- Log out button - allows for users to end their session

### Features Left to Implement
- Chat application needs to be adjusted for different device with media queries

## Technologies Used

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
    - The project uses **CSS** to style the web page.

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
    - The project uses **HTML** to construct the web page elements.

- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
    - The project uses **JavaScript** to manipulate the DOM elements of the application.

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
    - The project uses **React JS** to build reusable UI components to simplify scalability of the web app.

- [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io/)
    - The **Chat Engine** API is used to build the Chat functionality of the web application.

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAoY-PBhCNARIsABcz773A-bXdKNQCUUyOzVuLYuDWRCamvu0O7k0cwFPE_c2f_leufaF2ZY0aAqEDEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    - **Firebase** is used as the backend for handling the social authentication of the app.

## Testing


### Bugs Found During Coding

- When testing the google social login for the first time no logout button was seen along with the expected page title
    - Upon logging in screen only showed a white screen with a welcome message and an animated icon of a hand during development stage of the React server
    - Ended the local server with `ctrl + c`, cleared all browsing history and data within 24 hours, and checked Chat.js component
    - Issue was resolved by moving `<ChatEngine height="calc(100vh-66px)" />` outside the div containing the logout button
- When testing facebook social login, there was a message prompt showing that the App was being accessed from an unsecure server and that the facebook authentication security settings needed to be updated for the app.
    - To resolve this, all **Client OAuth settings** in the facebook app as *unichatmessenger* was updated to yes under the Facebook Login settings section (except for `Force Web OAuth reauthentication`).
    - Previous step did not resolve the situation after running local development server with `npm start`.
    - Next action taken was by making local server run as ***https*** protocol instead of ***http***.
        - This was accomplished by following a YouTube video tutorial to create an SSL ticket for localhost 
            - [Setup HTTPS in Development With Create React App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neT7fmZ6sDE)
        - This resolved the situation after confirming the login of the facebook social authentication on local development environment

### Cross-platform Compatibility

- Launching the chat application function as it should on Chrome and Microsoft Edge
- The chat app failed device responsiveness test for different screen sizes on both platform
    - Need to implement media queries to resolve the issue


### UX tests

- ??

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
